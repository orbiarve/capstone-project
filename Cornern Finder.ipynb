    "According to the Census around 35.5 million Americans move each year to new cities. The most stressful part of moving is finding a new neighborhood you can call home. The goal of this project is to find your corner every where you move or travel. Finding your corner is targeted to people that are relocating to a new place and want to find the environment they already love in another city. This is done by comparing two cities and creating a cluster among neighborhoods. "
